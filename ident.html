<a name="values"> <h2>Values</h2></a>

<p>
JavaScript recognizes the following types of values:
<ul>
<li>numbers, such as 42 or 3.14159
<li>logical (Boolean) values, either true or false
<li>strings, such as "Howdy!"
<li>null, a special keyword denoting a null value
</ul>
<p>
This relatively small set of types of values, or <i>data types</i>,
enables you to perform useful functions with your applications.  Notice that there
is no explicit distinction between integer and real-valued numbers.  Nor is there
an explicit date data type in Navigator.  However, the date object and related
built-in functions enable you to handle dates.
<p>
Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language.
You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures
that your application can perform.

<h3>Datatype Conversion</h3>
<p>
JavaScript is a loosely typed language.  That means that you do not have to specify
the datatype of a variable when you declare it, and datatypes are converted
automatically as needed during the course of script execution.  So, for example, you could define a variable as follows:
<pre>
var answer = 42
</pre>
<p>
And later, you could assign the same variable a string value, for example:
<pre>
answer = "Thanks for all the fish..."
</pre>
<p>
Because JavaScript is loosely typed, this will not cause an error message.
<p>
In general, in expressions involving numeric and string values, JavaScript converts the numeric values to strings.
For example, consider the following statements:
<pre>
x = "The answer is " + 42
y = 42 + " is the answer."
</pre>
<p>
The first statement will the string "The answer is 42".  The second statement will return the string "42 is the answer".

<p>
JavaScript provides several special functions for manipulating string and numeric values:
<ul>
<li><a href="builtin.html#eval">eval</a>attempts to evaluate a string representing any JavaScript literals or variables,
converting it to a number.
<li><a href="builtin.html#parseInt">parseInt</a> converts a string to an integer of the specified radix (base), if possible.
<li><a href="builtin.html#parseInt">parseFloat</a> converts a string to a floating-point number, if possible.
</ul>

<hr>
<a name="names"> <h2>Variables</h2></a>
<p>
You use variables to hold values in your application. You
give these variables <i>names</i> by which you reference them,
and there are certain rules to which the names must conform.
<p>
A JavaScript identifier or <i>name</i> must start with a letter or
underscore (&quot;_&quot;); subsequent characters can also be
digits (0-9). Letters include the characters &quot;A&quot; through
&quot;Z&quot; (uppercase) and the characters &quot;a&quot; through
&quot;z&quot; (lowercase).
JavaScript is case-sensitive.
<p>
Some examples of legal names are:
<ul>
<li><code>Number_hits</code>
<li><code>temp99</code>
<li><code>_name</code>
</ul>

<h3>Variable scope</h3>
<p>
The <i>scope</i> of a variable is where you can use it in a script.
In JavaScript, there are two scopes that a variable can have:
<ul>
<li>global: you can use the variable anywhere in the application.
<li>local: you can use the variable within the current function.
</ul>

<p>
To declare a local variable inside a function, use the <b>var</b> keyword,
for example:
<pre>
var total = 0
</pre>
<p>
To declare a global variable, declare the variable by assignment, that is
simply assign the desired value to the variable (either in a function or
outside a function), for example:
<pre>
total = 0
</pre>
<p>
It is good programming practice to
declare global variables at the beginning of your script, so
that functions will inherit the variable and its value.


<hr>
<a name="literals"> <h2>Literals</h2></a>

<p>
Literals are the way you represent values in JavaScript.
These are fixed values that you <i>literally</i> provide in your
application source, and are not variables. Examples of literals
include:
<ul>
<li><code>42</code>
<li><code>3.14159</code>
<li><code>&quot;To be or not to be&quot;</code>
</ul>

<h3>Integers</h3>

<p>
Integers can be expressed in decimal (base 10), hexadecimal (base
16), or octal (base 8) format. A decimal integer literal consists
of a sequence of digits (optionally suffixed as described below)
without a leading 0 (zero).
<p>
An integer can be expressed in octal or hexadecimal rather than
decimal. A leading 0 (zero) on an integer literal means it is
in octal; a leading 0x (or 0X) means hexadecimal. Hexadecimal
integers can include digits (0-9) and the letters a-f and A-F.
Octal integers can include only the digits 0-7.

<h3>Floating Point Literals</h3>

<p>
A floating point literal can have the following parts: a decimal
integer, a decimal point (&quot;.&quot;), a fraction (another
decimal number), an exponent, and a type suffix. The exponent
part is an "e" or "E" followed by an integer, which can be signed (preceded by
a "+" or "-").
A floating point literal must have at least one digit, plus either
a decimal point or "e" (or "E"). Some examples of floating point literals
are:
<ul>
<li>3.1415
<li>-3.1E12
<li>.1e12
<li>2E-12
</ul>

<h3>Boolean Literals</h3>

<p>
The boolean type has two literal values: <b>true</b> and <b>false</b>.

<h3>String Literals</h3>
<p>
A string literal is zero or more characters enclosed in double
(&quot;) or single (') quotes. A string must be delimited by quotes
of the same type; that is, either both single quotes or double
quotes. The following are examples of string literals:
<ul>
<li><code>&quot;blah&quot;</code>
<li><code>'blah'</code>
<li><code>&quot;1234&quot;</code>
<li><code>&quot;one line \n another line&quot;</code>
</ul>

<h4>Special Characters</h4>
<p>
You can use the following special characters in JavaScript string literals:
<ul>
<li><b>\b</b> indicates a backspace.
<li><b>\f</b> indicates a a form feed.
<li><b>\n</b> indicates a new line character.
<li><b>\r</b> indicates a carriage return.
<li><b>\t</b> indicates a tab character.
</ul>

<h4>Escaping Characters</h4>
<p>
You can insert quotes inside of strings by preceding them by a backslash.
This is known as <i>escaping</i> the quotes.
For example,
<pre>
var quote = "He read \"The Cremation of Sam McGee\" by R.W. Service"
document.write(quote)
</pre>
<p>
The result of this would be<p>
<script>
var quote = "He read \"The Cremation of Sam McGee\" by R.W. Service"
document.write(quote)
</script>

</body> </html>
